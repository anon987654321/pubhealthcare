## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Norwegian Business Plan with Framework Support

```ruby
# Using the enhanced framework for Norwegian business planning
class NorwegianBusinessPlanGenerator
  def initialize
    @framework = MasterJsonFramework.new(version: "v10.2.0")
    @norwegian_expert = @framework.role("norwegian_business_expert")
    @innovasjon_norge = @framework.integration("innovasjon_norge")
  end

  def generate_plan(business_idea)
    # Phase 1: Empathize and Analyze with Norwegian context
    analysis = @norwegian_expert.analyze(business_idea, {
      cultural_context: "lagom_principles",
      regional_focus: "distrikt_development",
      funding_alignment: @innovasjon_norge.matching_categories(business_idea)
    })

    # Phase 2: Define and Design with cultural compliance
    design = @framework.design_phase(analysis, {
      cultural_compliance: "lagom_validated",
      sustainability_focus: "carbon_neutral",
      innovation_metrics: "innovasjon_norge_readiness"
    })

    # Continue through all phases...
    @framework.execute_workflow(design)
  end
end
```

### Example 2: Meta-Learning Pattern Recognition

```ruby
# Implementing meta-learning for workflow optimization
class WorkflowOptimizer
  def initialize
    @framework = MasterJsonFramework.new(version: "v10.2.0")
    @pattern_recognizer = @framework.meta_learning.pattern_recognition
    @self_modifier = @framework.meta_learning.self_modification
  end

  def optimize_workflow(project_data)
    # Analyze success patterns
    success_patterns = @pattern_recognizer.analyze_success_patterns(project_data)
    
    # Identify improvement opportunities
    improvements = @self_modifier.generate_improvements(success_patterns)
    
    # Test improvements with A/B testing
    @self_modifier.test_improvements(improvements)
    
    # Apply validated improvements
    validated_improvements = @self_modifier.get_validated_improvements
    @framework.apply_improvements(validated_improvements)
  end
end
```

### Example 3: Cultural Compliance Validation

```ruby
# Norwegian cultural compliance checker
class CulturalComplianceValidator
  def initialize
    @framework = MasterJsonFramework.new(version: "v10.2.0")
    @cultural_validator = @framework.quality_assurance.cultural_compliance
  end

  def validate_lagom_principles(content)
    lagom_score = @cultural_validator.assess_lagom_compliance(content)
    
    validations = {
      directness: assess_communication_directness(content),
      transparency: assess_transparency_level(content),
      work_life_balance: assess_balance_consideration(content),
      environmental_consciousness: assess_sustainability(content),
      social_responsibility: assess_stakeholder_focus(content)
    }
    
    overall_score = calculate_weighted_score(validations)
    
    {
      lagom_score: lagom_score,
      detailed_validations: validations,
      overall_cultural_compliance: overall_score,
      recommendations: generate_improvement_recommendations(validations)
    }
  end
end
```

## Quality Gates and Validation

### Enhanced Quality Gates
```json
{
  "gates": {
    "syntax": "no_errors",
    "tests": "90_percent_coverage",
    "security": "zero_trust_a_plus",
    "performance": "95_plus_core_web_vitals",
    "accessibility": "wcag_2_2_aaa",
    "formatting": "universal_consistency",
    "norwegian_cultural_compliance": "lagom_validated",
    "innovasjon_norge_readiness": "funding_criteria_met"
  }
}
```

### Adaptive Quality Gates
```ruby
# Quality gates that adapt based on learning
class AdaptiveQualityGates
  def initialize
    @framework = MasterJsonFramework.new(version: "v10.2.0")
    @adaptive_gates = @framework.quality_assurance.adaptive_gates
  end

  def assess_quality(project)
    # Get current thresholds based on learning
    current_thresholds = @adaptive_gates.get_learned_thresholds(project.type)
    
    # Run quality assessment
    assessment = run_quality_checks(project, current_thresholds)
    
    # Update thresholds based on results
    @adaptive_gates.update_thresholds(assessment.results)
    
    assessment
  end
end
```

## Deployment and Monitoring

### Framework Deployment
```ruby
# Deploy enhanced framework with monitoring
class FrameworkDeployment
  def initialize
    @framework = MasterJsonFramework.new(version: "v10.2.0")
    @monitoring = @framework.deployment.monitoring
  end

  def deploy_with_monitoring
    # Deploy framework
    deployment_result = @framework.deploy({
      environment: "production",
      norwegian_compliance: "enabled",
      meta_learning: "enabled",
      monitoring: "comprehensive"
    })

    # Setup monitoring
    @monitoring.setup({
      health_checks: ["service_status", "resource_usage"],
      logging: ["error_tracking", "performance_metrics"],
      alerts: ["service_down", "compliance_violations"],
      norwegian_specific: ["lagom_score_tracking", "innovasjon_norge_readiness"]
    })

    deployment_result
  end
end
```

### Performance Monitoring
```ruby
# Monitor framework performance and learning
class FrameworkMonitor
  def initialize
    @framework = MasterJsonFramework.new(version: "v10.2.0")
    @success_metrics = @framework.self_optimization.success_metrics
  end

  def monitor_performance
    current_metrics = {
      completion_rate: measure_completion_rate,
      satisfaction: measure_user_satisfaction,
      quality: measure_quality_compliance,
      performance: measure_lighthouse_scores,
      norwegian_business_success: measure_innovasjon_norge_approval_rate,
      cultural_compliance: measure_lagom_score
    }

    # Compare against targets
    performance_assessment = @success_metrics.assess_against_targets(current_metrics)
    
    # Generate improvement recommendations
    if performance_assessment.needs_improvement?
      improvements = @framework.meta_learning.generate_improvements(performance_assessment)
      @framework.apply_improvements(improvements)
    end

    performance_assessment
  end
end
```

## Best Practices

- Use adaptive features to optimize role weighting
- Enable predictive resource allocation
- Integrate best practices automatically

### 4. Quality Assurance
- Use adaptive quality gates that learn from project outcomes
- Implement multi-layered validation chains
- Ensure Norwegian cultural compliance validation
- Monitor Innovasjon Norge readiness for business projects

## Migration from v10.0.0 to v10.2.0

### Step 1: Update Framework Configuration
```ruby
# Update existing framework usage
old_framework = MasterJsonFramework.new(version: "v10.0.0")
new_framework = MasterJsonFramework.new(version: "v10.2.0")

# Migrate configuration
migration_result = new_framework.migrate_from(old_framework)
```

### Step 2: Enable New Features
```ruby
# Enable Norwegian business integration
new_framework.enable_norwegian_integration({
  business_expert: true,
  innovasjon_norge: true,
  distrikt_development: true,
  cultural_compliance: true
})

# Enable meta-learning
new_framework.enable_meta_learning({
  pattern_recognition: true,
  self_modification: true,
  adaptive_optimization: true
})
```

### Step 3: Validate Migration
```ruby
# Validate successful migration
validator = MasterJsonValidator.new("prompts/master_v10_2_0.json")
validation_result = validator.validate_all

if validation_result.passed?
  puts "Migration successful! Framework v10.2.0 is ready for use."
else
  puts "Migration issues detected. Please review and fix."
end
```
